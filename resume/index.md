## Work Experience

### <a href="http://datacom.co.nz/"><img style="width: 13%" src="/images/resume/datacom.png"></a> Software Developer 
<p style="margin-top:-3.5%">(Wellington, New Zealand - Sep. 2012-Present)</p>

Adam has worked on a number of applications at Datacom. To note some:

**Checkmate**: This was a Java application that needed to be re-platformed to a Ruby on Rails application. A number of additional features were also required to be integrated. <br> It needed to handle both WebService and REST calls, and the ability to manage both incoming / outgoing SMS messages. <br> This was Test Driven application using an Agile Iterative approach. <br> This allowed the Customer piece of mind as well as seeing results fast.

**Speicific Gems To Note:** Sidekiq, Savon, Foreman, Bootstrap, Devise, Excon, Minitest, Pry
{: .notice}

**Ministry of Justice Case Management System**: On this system, Adam was able to gain the insight of working on a large legacy Java application. He gained the necessities in order to develop, support and meet complex legislative changes in a timely manner. <br> Adam was exposed to all areas of the system from  Development, Support, Test and even Business Analysis.<br>
This project used a Waterfall approach and given the sensitivity of the application, required a great deal of correspondence with the client.


**TextSecure**: Adam worked on implementing and understanding the [TextSecure Java Library](https://whispersystems.github.io/libtextsecure-java/reference/packages.html) in order to create a Java API to interact with a Ruby on Rails API. He created the Java API using Spring Boot with REST calls, which would forward on information to the Ruby on Rails application. This was an interesting project due to the underlying complexity, security and cryptography techniques.
