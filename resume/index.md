## Work Experience

### <a href="http://datacom.co.nz/"><img style="width: 13%" src="/images/resume/datacom.png"></a> Software Developer 
<p style="margin-top:-3.5%">(Wellington, New Zealand - Sep. 2012-Feb. 2016)</p>

**Discretion**: 
Was the primary developer on an application called Discretion, which is an application to showcase security, messaging, and collaboration features. It has two-factor authentication, and it allows two-way encrypted end-to-end messaging with native apps, backed by [Open Whispers Systems (Signal)](https://whispersystems.org/).
It includes two-way emailing, group messaging, and the ability to secure image / video uploads, as well as providing multi tiers of privacy and sensitivity of messages.<br><br>
Discretion is a Ruby on Rails application that works in conjunction with a Java application. It relies on a number of API calls, using callbacks to complete end-to-end transactions between the applications. It is backed by a Postgres database using Redis for background jobs. A lot of research was required, as well as a deep understanding of Open Whisper Systems libraries.

**Gems Of Note**: u2f, devise, devise_google_authenticator, devise_invitable, paperclip, interactor, foreman, pundit, mailgun-ruby, minitest, pry
{: .notice}

**Checkmate**: 
Helped to develop Checkmate, which was designed to enable Chorus (telecommunication company) technicians to retrieve diagnostic information about a data line, whilst located at a customer location. It gives the technicians the ability to send a SMS code to a designated number, and receive relative information directly to their mobile. <br><br>
This was a Java application that needed to be re-platformed to Ruby on Rails, with a  number of additional features. It needed to handle both Web-Service and REST calls, with the ability to manage both incoming and outgoing SMS messages. This was developed using a test driven approach in an agile, iterative environment. 

**Gems To Note:** sidekiq, interactor, savon, foreman, bootstrap, excon, kaminari, lograge, devise, devise_ldap_authenticatable, minitest, pry, ruby-oci8, activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter
{: .notice}

**Ministry of Justice Case Management System**: 
Worked as a development and support analyst on CMS; a Government application enabled to deliver Court and Tribunal services for Civil, Criminal, Family, and Environmental Courts. It is a large, complex, legacy Java application which required regular legislative changes. These changes had to be made within strict time-lines to meet Parliament requirements. It is the central block for the courts system, which provides several interfaces connecting different agencies including Police, Corrections, and Collections. Development was undertaken with a waterfall approach.
