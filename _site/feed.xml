    &lt;p&gt;On the 2nd May, I completed one of the most fulfilling journeys of my life thus far. I trained in an intensive 12 week training programme (roughly 20 hours a week) to compete for a position to fight in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itheavyhitters.co.nz/&quot;&gt;IT Heavy Hitters&lt;/a&gt;. This was to raise funds for &lt;a href=&quot;http://keytolife.org.nz/&quot;&gt;The Key To Life Charitable Trust&lt;/a&gt;. I was lucky enough to be matched against an opponent, who happened to be a Solution Architect from ANZ in Wellington. When I was told that I was matched 4 weeks out from the fight it became an emotional roller-coaster. My training stepped up another level and my diet became very bland, let alone touching any alcohol. In my head I knew if I didn’t train hard, I would come of second best. It was very hard to prevent myself in finding out more about my opponent before the fight. I was hearing comments through the grape vine that did nothing for my nerves, this included being told he was a professional power lifter as teenager and losing over 40kgs within 3 months before the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: auto; width: 80%; display: block; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;/images/itheavyhitters/itheavyhitters8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Getting Ready For The Fight&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; border=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before the fight was weigh in. This was the first time my opponent and I had come face to face. Our fight weight was set at 84kg, however I knew I was lighter than this from all the training I had been doing. My opponent weighed in first. Surprisingly he weighed in at 79.6kgs, I was in shock as I would have a weight advantage. It was my turn to weigh in. I was weighed at 80.6kg  the lightest I have ever been, but still heavier than my opponent albeit 1kg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: auto; width: 80%; display: block; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;/images/itheavyhitters/itheavyhitters6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Getting Ready For The Fight&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; border=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 24 hours I have never been more scared in my life. Feelings on whether I had done enough training, was I ready for the fight and even the chance of being seriously injured was hard to take in. But on the other hand, excitement was there. I trained so hard I was just ready to get out there and give it my all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time came for my turn to walk out to the ring. My team was cheering, the crowd was clapping, music was playing but all I could see was my opponent. In my head all I could think of was what combos I was going to throw and what punches were going to come flying my way. The referee brought us together to go over the rules, at this stage I completely stopped listening as I knew in a matter of seconds it was all on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fight starts, nerves and adrenalin are pumping through my veins. From here it becomes a little weary as all I am doing is avoiding punches. It takes me half the round before finding my rhythm. I finally start to get my range, when I hear the 10 second clicker to announce the end of the round is coming. All I could remember from training is “You must win the last 10 seconds of the round….”. I was still fill of energy and new I hadn’t done enough in the round. I saw an opening and took it, left, right, left, right, left, SUPERMAN punch…. He falls to the ground and all I see is a white towel thrown in. I had won the fight by knock out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before the fight was weigh in. This was the first time my opponent and I had come face to face. Our fight weight was set at 84kg, however I knew I was lighter than this from all the training I had been doing. My opponent weighed in first. Surprisingly he weighed in at 79.6kgs, I was in shock as I would have a weight advantage. It was my turn to weigh in. I was weighed at 80.6kg  the lightest I have ever been, but still heavier than my opponent albeit 1kg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 24 hours I have never been more scared in my life. Feelings on whether I had done enough training, was I ready for the fight and even the chance of being seriously injured was hard to take in. But on the other hand, excitement was there. I trained so hard I was just ready to get out there and give it my all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time came for my turn to walk out to the ring. My team was cheering, the crowd was clapping, music was playing but all I could see was my opponent. In my head all I could think of was what combos I was going to throw and what punches were going to come flying my way. The referee brought us together to go over the rules, at this stage I completely stopped listening as I knew in a matter of seconds it was all on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fight starts, nerves and adrenalin are pumping through my veins. From here it becomes a little weary as all I am doing is avoiding punches. It takes me half the round before finding my rhythm. I finally start to get my range, when I hear the 10 second clicker to announce the end of the round is coming. All I could remember from training is “You must win the last 10 seconds of the round….”. I was still fill of energy and new I hadn’t done enough in the round. I saw an opening and took it, left, right, left, right, left, SUPERMAN punch…. He falls to the ground and all I see is a white towel thrown in. I had won the fight by knock out!&lt;/p&gt;
