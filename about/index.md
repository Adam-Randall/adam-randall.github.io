Welcome to "A Kiwi Look Into I.T." <br><br>

For those that don't know me, my name is Adam and I am Software <br>Developer from little old Dunedin, New Zealand.<br><br>

When I was first introduced to Software Development, it was always my plan<br>  to start up a Blog. This was not only to share my thoughts on what I have learn't in <br> Software Development, but also showcase interesting experiences that I have encountered throughout my life.

So please take a look around, read my posts and enjoy!
