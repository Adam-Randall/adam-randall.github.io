Welcome to "A Kiwi Look Into I.T." <br><br>

For those that don't know me, my name is Adam and I am Software <br>Developer from little old Dunedin, New Zealand.<br><br>

When first getting introduced to Software Developing, it was always my plan  to start up a Blog, to share my thoughts on what I have learn't, not only about Software Development, but all things interesting to me.
