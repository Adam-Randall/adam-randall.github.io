On the 2nd May, I completed one of the most fulfilling journeys of my life thus far. I trained in an intensive 12 week training programme (roughly 20 hours a week) to compete for a position to fight in [IT Heavy Hitters](http://www.itheavyhitters.co.nz/). This was to raise funds for [The Key To Life Charitable Trust](http://keytolife.org.nz/). I was lucky enough to be matched against an opponent, who happened to be a Solution Architect from ANZ in Wellington. When I was told that I was matched 4 weeks out from the fight it became an emotional roller-coaster. My training stepped up another level and my diet became very bland, let alone touching any alcohol. In my head I knew if I didn’t train hard, I would come of second best. It was very hard to prevent myself in finding out more about my opponent before the fight. I was hearing comments through the grape vine that did nothing for my nerves, this included being told he was a professional power lifter as teenager and losing over 40kgs within 3 months before the fight.

The night before the fight was weigh in. This was the first time my opponent and I had come face to face. Our fight weight was set at 84kg, however I knew I was lighter than this from all the training I had been doing. My opponent weighed in first. Surprisingly he weighed in at 79.6kgs, I was in shock as I would have a weight advantage. It was my turn to weigh in. I was weighed at 80.6kg  the lightest I have ever been, but still heavier than my opponent albeit 1kg.

The next 24 hours I have never been more scared in my life. Feelings on whether I had done enough training, was I ready for the fight and even the chance of being seriously injured was hard to take in. But on the other hand, excitement was there. I trained so hard I was just ready to get out there and give it my all.

The time came for my turn to walk out to the ring. My team was cheering, the crowd was clapping, music was playing but all I could see was my opponent. In my head all I could think of was what combos I was going to throw and what punches were going to come flying my way. The referee brought us together to go over the rules, at this stage I completely stopped listening as I knew in a matter of seconds it was all on.

The fight starts, nerves and adrenalin are pumping through my veins. From here it becomes a little weary as all I am doing is avoiding punches. It takes me half the round before finding my rhythm. I finally start to get my range, when I hear the 10 second clicker to announce the end of the round is coming. All I could remember from training is “You must win the last 10 seconds of the round….”. I was still fill of energy and new I hadn’t done enough in the round. I saw an opening and took it, left, right, left, right, left, SUPERMAN punch…. He falls to the ground and all I see is a white towel thrown in. I had won the fight by knock out!
